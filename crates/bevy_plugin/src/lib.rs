//! # Bevy Yarn Spinner
//!
//! This is the Bevy integration for Yarn Spinner, the friendly dialogue creation tool for Rust.
//! It allows you to easily create dialogue systems in your game.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The three main types you will interact with are:
//! - [`YarnSpinnerPlugin`]: The plugin registering all systems and types.
//! - [`YarnProject`]: A [`Resource`](bevy::prelude::Resource) for the compiled Yarn project, which is created for you when [`YarnSpinnerPlugin`] is added.
//! - [`DialogueRunner`]: The [`Component`](bevy::prelude::Component) running through the Yarn files and sending events for things you should draw on the screen.
//!   Can be created from a [`YarnProject`].
//!
//! ## Dialogue Views
//!
//! The dialogue runner itself does not draw anything to the screen, it only tells you what content to present.
//! Any plugin that handles the actual drawing is called a *dialogue view*. We provide an [example dialogue view](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_yarnspinner_example_dialogue_view)
//! that you can use to explore the features of Yarn Spinner and get started quickly.
//!
//! Specifically, a dialogue view is required to do the following things
//! - Handle the [`PresentLine`](crate::events::PresentLine) event and draw the line to the screen.
//! - Handle the [`PresentOptions`](crate::events::PresentOptions) event and draw the options to the screen.
//! - Call [`DialogueRunner::continue_in_next_update`](crate::prelude::DialogueRunner::continue_in_next_update) when the user wishes to continue the dialogue.
//! - Pass a user's option selection to the right dialogue runner via [`DialogueRunner::select_option`](crate::prelude::DialogueRunner::select_option).
//!
//! See the documentation for the [`events`] module for additional optional events that may be handled
//!
//! Note that while [`DialogueRunner`]s are setup in such a way that you can have multiple instances running in parallel (such as for split-screen co-op),
//! a general-purpose dialogue view is not required to support this use-case, as every game that does this will have it's own way of wanting to deal with this.
//! In particular, the [example dialogue view](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_yarnspinner_example_dialogue_view) only supports a single [`DialogueRunner`].
//!
//! ## Demo
//!
//! You can play a the [Yarn Spinner for Rust Demo](https://janhohenheim.itch.io/yarnspinner-rust-demo) in your browser to see the aforementioned example dialogue view in action.
//! Additionally, there are [many examples](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Rust/tree/main/examples/bevy_yarnspinner/src/bin) that you can check out.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! The main workflow is as follows:
//! - Register the [`YarnSpinnerPlugin`]
//! - When the [`YarnProject`] [`Resource`](bevy::prelude::Resource) is added, spawn a [`DialogueRunner`] from it.
//!   The latter can nicely be done with `my_system.run_if(resource_added::<YarnProject>)`.
//!
//! The following example is adapted from the [hello world example](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Rust/blob/main/examples/bevy_yarnspinner/src/bin/hello_world.rs).
//!
//! ```text
//! # assets/dialogue/hello_world.yarn
//! title: Start
//! ---
//! Hello world!
//! ===
//! ```
//!
//! ```no_run
//! // src/main.rs
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//! use bevy_yarnspinner::prelude::*;
//! // Use the example dialogue view to see the dialogue in action. Requires the `bevy_yarnspinner_example_dialogue_view` crate.
//! // use bevy_yarnspinner_example_dialogue_view::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut app = App::new();
//!     app.add_plugins((
//!         // Add the Yarn Spinner plugin.
//!         // As soon as this plugin is built, a Yarn project will be compiled
//!         // from all Yarn files found under assets/dialog/*.yarn
//!         YarnSpinnerPlugin::new(),
//!         // Initialize the bundled example UI. Requires the `bevy_yarnspinner_example_dialogue_view` crate.
//!         // ExampleYarnSpinnerDialogueViewPlugin::new(),
//!     ))
//!     // Setup a 2D camera so we can see the text
//!     .add_systems(Startup, setup_camera)
//!     // Spawn the dialog as soon as the Yarn project finished compiling
//!     .add_systems(
//!         Update,
//!         spawn_dialogue_runner.run_if(resource_added::<YarnProject>),
//!     )
//!     .run();
//! }
//!
//! fn setup_camera(mut commands: Commands) {
//!     commands.spawn(Camera2d::default());
//! }
//!
//! fn spawn_dialogue_runner(mut commands: Commands, project: Res<YarnProject>) {
//!     let mut dialogue_runner = project.create_dialogue_runner(&mut commands);
//!     // Start the dialog at the node with the title "Start"
//!     dialogue_runner.start_node("Start");
//!     commands.spawn(dialogue_runner);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`DialogueRunner`]: crate::prelude::DialogueRunner
//! [`YarnProject`]: crate::prelude::YarnProject
//! [`YarnSpinnerPlugin`]: crate::prelude::YarnSpinnerPlugin
