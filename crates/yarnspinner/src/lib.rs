//! # Yarn Spinner for Rust
//! The friendly dialogue creation tool for Rust.
//!
//! This crate provides a compiler and runtime that can be used standalone, but will most likely be used by a crate providing the functionality
//! to a game engine. For example, [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine support is given by the [`bevy_yarnspinner`](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_yarnspinner) crate.
